# the idea of dfs is to go to the max depth and like explaore  all possible paths
#  they are usually implemented in backtracking, recurssion, exaustuve  possible paths
# implemented using a stack


# > we will be having 3 variables, a stack, a visitedm, final arr 
# > starying from tyhe roor node
# > we add the  root element to visted array and final arr 
# > and add all the child elements to the stack 
# > for eacj element in the array we follow the same process 
# > we check if it is already visited , if visited, dont do anything
