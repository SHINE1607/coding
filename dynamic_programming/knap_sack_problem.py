#  0/1 knap sack problem 
#  Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of 
# capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, 
# given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values 
# and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W 
# which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of 
# al[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal 
# to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick 
# it (0-1 property).
